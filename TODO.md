# Running TODO List

## Backend

## Frontend
- [ ] Would love a badge that shows the % of weeks I've finished my mileage goal
- [ ] A numeric dashboard that shows basic numbers (weight loss %)
- [ ] Step count plot
- [ ] Fix tooltips between different plots

## Analytics
- [ ] Aggregations look super wrong in the clean models (250K steps per day)
- [ ] Don't have any food scores modeled yet
- [ ] Workout intensity over time
- [ ] Can we get metrics per split? Maybe from Strava?
